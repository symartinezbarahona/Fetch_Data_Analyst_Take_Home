# Fetch Data Analyst Take Home
## Overview
In this take home, I will demonstrate my ability to reason about data as well as showcase how I communicate findings and insights with stakeholders and business executives.

----
## Requirements
### 1. Explore the data
- Are there any data quality issues present?
- Are there any fields that are challenging to understand?

### 2. Provide SQL queries

Answer three of the following questions with at least one question coming from the closed-ended and one from the open-ended question set. Each question should be answered using one query.

Closed-ended questions:
- What are the top 5 brands by receipts scanned among users 21 and over?
- What are the top 5 brands by sales among users that have had their account for at least six months?
- What is the percentage of sales in the Health & Wellness category by generation?

Open-ended questions: for these, make assumptions and clearly state them when answering the question.
- Who are Fetchâ€™s power users?
 - Which is the leading brand in the Dips & Salsa category?
 - At what percent has Fetch grown year over year?

### 3. Communicate with stakeholders
    
Construct an email or slack message that is understandable to a product or business leader who is not familiar with your day-to-day work. Summarize the results of your investigation. Include:
- Key data quality issues and outstanding questions about the data
- One interesting trend in the data
    - Use a finding from part 2 or come up with a new insight
- Request for action: explain what additional help, info, etc. you need to make sense of the data and resolve any outstanding issues
